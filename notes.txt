Ph.D. student Stijn De Bruyne at LMS, Moritz on committee

Improved the latency of our visual kite tracking system by an order of magnitude by
writing an O(n) feature extractor that makes a single pass through the image data
rather than four.  

Designed a line angle sensor mechanism that is capable of 360 degrees rotation without resorting to sliprings or wireless communication.

Starting with a codebase with partially automated build that was maintained in one user account on a single machine, 
Increased number of targets in our flight code that build automatically from about 60% to 100%.

Designed software and hardware architecture for the next generation of power producing plane at KULeuven.  

Recruited, trained, and supervised a team of four electrical engineering job students

Supervised two master's thesis projects

Defined and enforced safety precautions that achieved a perfect safety record despite having students working on machinery that is potentially lethal from both mechanical and electrical standpoints.

(Quadrupled the timing accuracy of signals in our system by triggering the cameras in hardware,
and installing and tuning priorities of threads in linux with realtime patches.)
(Wrote a parametric design for a 3D printed multiport air data probe for measuring angle of attack)
(Optimized the design of a kite launching carousel with dramatically reduced cost and weight)
